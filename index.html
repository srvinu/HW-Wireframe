            <p class="content"> Trends change in every arena from fashion to education every day. Similar is the case of software development trends. In fact, in the era of digitalization, software development is one of those fields which is changing at an extremely fast pace. </p>

            <p class="content">Every year brings some brand new surprises for software developers. 2018 was the year of complete acceleration for the software development companies worldwide. From blockchain to Artificial intelligence, software technologies have remained a hot topic throughout the year.</p>
            
            <p class="content"> According to a report by Gartner in 2018, the IT industry has seen dramatic growth. It has also forecast growth of 8.3 % in 2019.</p>
            
            <p class="content">Most of the full stack developers are using Javascript to program the software. The popularity of this language is due to its great adaptivity for hybrid applications as well.</p>
            
            <p class="content">In the stack overflow survey of commonly used programming languages, Node.js scored 49.9% and Angular scored 39.6%. Some other popular languages are React, .NET core, spring etc. Here is the graphical representation of their findings:</p>

        <p class="content"> Work in Artificial Intelligence in the EECS department at Berkeley involves foundational research in core areas of knowledge representation, reasoning, learning, planning, decision-making, vision, robotics, speech and language processing. There are also significant efforts aimed at applying algorithmic advances to applied problems in a range of areas, including bioinformatics, networking and systems, search and information retrieval. There are active collaborations with several groups on campus, including the campus-wide vision sciences group, the information retrieval group at the I-School and the campus-wide computational biology program. There are also connections to a range of research activities in the cognitive sciences, including aspects of psychology, linguistics, and philosophy. Work in this area also involves techniques and tools from statistics, neuroscience, control, optimization, and operations research. Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR).</p>
        <h2> Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</h2>
        <p class="content"> The Human-Computer Interaction Group studies interaction in future computing environments including the office, home, mobile and medical. Emphasis on context-aware systems, perceptual interfaces (like computer vision and speech), visualization and learning technologies. The BID lab is a 4000-sq ft lab designed to foster collaboration, and houses about 25 students from CS, ME, BioE and Art practice. The Tele-immersive lab has about 10 students and postdocs from EECS, Humanities and Dance department and has extensive collaboration with faculty from University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.</p>

            <p class="content"> Cloud computing makes computer system resources, especially storage and computing power, available on demand without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an Edge server.</p>
            <p class="content"> Major Cloud providers are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) , Oracle and IBM </p>

                <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        </header>

        <p class="content">Because of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past. It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks; researchers interested in artificial intelligence wanted to see if computers could learn from data. The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they are able to independently adapt. They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results. It's a science that’s not new – but one that has gained fresh momentum.</p>
        <p class="content">Python. Python is considered to be in the first place in the list of all AI development languages due to the simplicity</p>

            </header>
            
            <p class="content">Big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex for traditional data-processing application software to adequately deal with.</p>
            <p class="content"> An example of big data might be petabytes (1,024 terabytes) or exabytes (1,024 petabytes) of data consisting of billions to trillions of records of millions of people—all from different sources (e.g. Web, sales, customer contact center, social media, mobile data and so on). The data is typically loosely structured data that is often incomplete and inaccessible.</p>

                    <h1>BOTS</h1>
            </header>
            
            <p class="content"> BOT is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet.[1] Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone. The largest use of bots is in web spidering (web crawler), in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human. More than half of all web traffic is made up of bots.</p>
